          Hi, I'm James. I typically go by anything other than James. Jimmy, Jim, Jimbo, Slim Jim, Jimmy Neutron, I've heard it all. Just pick one and
          roll with it.

          My love for Software Engineering started in High School where I took two years of "Web Design". The class itself was terrible. Our teacher
          didn't know a thing about programming, so we used a drag-and-drop site builder from the early 2000s. As you can imagine, the sites we built
          were horrendously styled and very cookie cutter. This inspired me to start learning HTML, CSS, and some very basic JavaScript. With these
          newfound powers, I was able to make something worth showing off!
          <br />
          <br />
          Fast forward to 2021, I enrolled to a Web Development Bootcamp at LSU. Hands down the best decision I've ever made. After some vigourous
          instruction, hard work, and dedication I was confidently able to build and deploy full-stack web applications.
